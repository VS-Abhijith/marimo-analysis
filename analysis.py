# Description: Interactive Marimo notebook demonstrating relationship between variables

# --- Cell 1: Create dataset ---
# We generate a synthetic dataset of X and Y values.
# The variable 'data' created here will be reused in later cells.
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = 2 * x + np.random.normal(0, 2, 100)
data = pd.DataFrame({"X": x, "Y": y})

# --- Cell 2: Define slider widget ---
# This slider allows us to choose how many points to sample from 'data'.
# The variable 'slider.value' will flow into Cell 3 and Cell 4.
slider = mo.ui.slider(10, 100, value=50)

# --- Cell 3: Sample dataset based on slider ---
# This cell depends on:
#   - 'data' from Cell 1
#   - 'slider.value' from Cell 2
# It produces 'sample', which will be used in Cell 5 to plot the data.
sample = data.sample(slider.value, random_state=42)

# --- Cell 4: Dynamic Markdown ---
# This Markdown cell depends directly on 'slider.value' from Cell 2.
# When the slider changes, this text automatically updates.

# --- Cell 5: Visualization ---
# This visualization depends on:
