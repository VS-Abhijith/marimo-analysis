# Description: Interactive Marimo notebook demonstrating relationship between variables

import marimo as mo
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# --- Cell 1: Dataset creation ---
# Generate synthetic data (x, y with noise)
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = 2 * x + np.random.normal(0, 2, 100)
data = pd.DataFrame({"X": x, "Y": y})

# --- Cell 2: Interactive slider ---
# This slider controls the size of the sample
slider = mo.ui.slider(10, 100, value=50)

# --- Cell 3: Variable dependency on slider ---
# Sample depends on slider value
sample = data.sample(slider.value, random_state=42)
